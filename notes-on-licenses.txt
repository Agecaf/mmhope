While MM:Hope will be public domain from version 1.0.0, that cannot be said of all the things it is using.

ABOUT MODS
==========

Each Mod can have their own license. That means you could use your own assets without
giving them for commercial purposes, for example, or that you could use assets with
attribution licenses.

This also means that you can make proprietary mods, but for that I'd recommend forking the
whole project and making it your own engine, rather than depending on the potentially-changing
engine.

That being said, it'd be really awesome to have more public domain stuff we can hack 'n share!
