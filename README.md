# Mod-Me: Hell Of Peaceful Embodiments!

This is a bullet hell game where you don't have to shoot!

It looks at bullet hell in a different way though; functional!
This means bullets are not "updated" each frame, but we know exactly where they
are, in the present, past, or future!

## I'm looking for...
### How to play this!
It's not ready yet!

### How to mod this!
It's not ready yet!

### How to collaborate in this project!
This will be open for collaboration from version 1.0.0.

(You'll be able to make suggestions on itch.io)

## Current Version: 0.0.0

There's just the bare-bones so far! There's much to be done!

## Road Map
### 0.0.1
- The first modding framework.
- The basic com.agecaf.mmhope.utils for making bullets, with ShapeRender.
- A basic game engine.
- A demo level!

### 1.0.0
- This will become Public Domain (Unlicense), and open for collaboration.
